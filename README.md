# Project Overview
### Project Scientific Braille - a prototype that has an integrated braille keypad input and mechanical discs rotating braille display interfaced with a raspberry pi

# Project Features
### 1.) Braille keypad input
This project includes braille keypad input that will be responsible to work as a scientific calculator for the blind. It also supports basic trigonometric functions like sine, cosine, tangent, asin, acos, atan, logarithm, natural logarithm, etc. 
### 2.) Braille Mechanical output display
This project includes a braille mechanical output display that is represented through braille discs which rotate corresponding to the mathematical expresison output. In order for this to function, two stepper motors was used.
### 3.) Voice prompt output (can be interfaced with an auxiliary speakers or headset)
This project also includes a voice prompt ouput whenever there's a keypad input. It has text-to-speech function that translate the expression to speech. This can be turned on or off.
### 4.) Interfaced Basic GUI
This project also provides a basic GUI that served as a screen display for the mathematical expression for checking.

## Additional Features
* Pressing Clear Button for at least 5 seconds will turn on/off mechanical mode -- meaning that the mechanical will or will not function accordingly
* Pressing '0' Button for at least 3 seconds will make the linear motor move (from right-to-left) one disc space
